# Ukraine-Russia-War-Visualisations

Dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war?datasetId=1967621&sortBy=voteCount 

Russian personnel and equipment losses from start of war in Ukraine until 16/11/22. Some of these visualisations are mine, others I found interesting and included here. 

I wanted to experiment with Plotly because of the nice-looking graphics and because it is more interactive than matplotlib or seaborn. However, in order to show the visualisations in the HTML file, I had to show the graphs as png files, which removes the interactive element.
